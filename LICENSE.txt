NRLIB is a software developed by Norsk Regnesentral. (2018)
NR has further developed the nrlib software for the APSGUI project.
It is for Statoil internal use only without any time limitations or any license fee.
Statoil has the source code and can compile it for which platform is needed.

It should not be re-distributed outside Statoil without an agreement with Norsk Regnesentral
since I don't know at the moment which status it has whether it is open source or not.

Information about the code:
The code was developed as a part of the APSGUI project and NR based their development of this code
on an internal software library called nrlib. They included 1D and 3D gaussian field simulations
for Statoil in addition to the 2D simulation and made a python wrapped so that it can be used from python scripts.
